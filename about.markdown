Hi, I'm Pavan Kalyan, a computer science and engineering student at Manipal Institute of Technology. I'm from Hyderabad, India.

I'm currently interning at [Hevo Data](https://hevodata.com/). I've previously interned at [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-in) and [TIF Labs](https://www.tiflabs.in/). I was part of [Linux Users' Group](https://www.lugm.xyz/) and [Robotics and Circuits Club](https://www.linkedin.com/company/robotics-and-circuits/about/). I also do some competitive coding once in a while on sites like [codeforces](https://codeforces.com/) and [atcoder](https://atcoder.jp/).

I am passionate about open source software and try to contribute regularly. Here are a few I have previously contributed to [Trickster](https://github.com/Comcast/trickster), [GoCity](https://github.com/rodrigo-brito/gocity), etc.

I enjoy playing video games and reading science fiction and fantasy books. My favorite sci-fi author is [Isaac Asimov](http://www.asimovonline.com/asimov_home_page.html) and my favorite fantasy author is [Brandon Sanderson](https://www.brandonsanderson.com/).
