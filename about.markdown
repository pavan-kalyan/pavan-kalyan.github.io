Hi, I'm Pavan Kalyan, a software engineer based out of Bangalore, India. I graduated from [Manipal Institute of Technology, Manipal](https://manipal.edu/mit.html){:target="_blank"} in 2020.

I'm currently working at [Hevo Data](https://hevodata.com/){:target="_blank"} as a SDE-II. I've previously interned at [Hevo Data](https://hevodata.com/){:target="_blank"}, [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-in){:target="_blank"} and [TIF Labs](https://www.tiflabs.in/){:target="_blank"}. During college, I was part of [Linux Users' Group](https://www.lugm.xyz/){:target="_blank"} and [Robotics and Circuits Club](https://www.linkedin.com/company/robotics-and-circuits/about/){:target="_blank"}. I also do some competitive coding once in a while on sites like [codeforces](https://codeforces.com/){:target="_blank"} and [atcoder](https://atcoder.jp/){:target="_blank"}.

I'm also interested in computer science research. More details [here]({% link research.markdown %}).

I am passionate about open source software and try to contribute regularly. Here are a few I have previously contributed to: [Jackson](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-core), [Depscloud](https://github.com/depscloud/depscloud){:target="_blank"}, [Trickster](https://github.com/Comcast/trickster){:target="_blank"}, [GoCity](https://github.com/rodrigo-brito/gocity){:target="_blank"}, etc.

I enjoy playing video games and reading science fiction and fantasy books. My favorite sci-fi author is [Isaac Asimov](http://www.asimovonline.com/asimov_home_page.html){:target="_blank"} and my favorite fantasy author is [Brandon Sanderson](https://www.brandonsanderson.com/){:target="_blank"}.
