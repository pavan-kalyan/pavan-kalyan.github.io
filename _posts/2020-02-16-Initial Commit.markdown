This is the first post in hopefully a long list of posts about various things I learn about in the world of computing.

So why start a blog?

There are many reasons to start a blog but I would like to highlight the reasons important to me:

* **It serves as a quick reference**:
Many times I find myself doing repeated activities like googling the solution to a problem I faced before because I forgot the exact steps or the exact code snippet. Having a blog post as documentation to the problem I faced with steps to the solution should save me time from solving it again.

* **It enhances the quality of my learning and my ability to communicate ideas**:
When learning new things, it is easy and tempting to skip over fine details and learn how to make it work rather than learn how it works. Writing a blog post of something I learn will force me to research more thoroughly and will ensure that I understand a concept and can implement it confidently, after all, you never really understand something if you can't explain it to others.

* **Sharing knowledge leads to more collaboration**:
As someone who has benefitted greatly from all the free resources and knowledge available on the internet, I firmly believe sharing knowledge leads to more collaboration and better technologies.

Ok, so what will you talk about?

Anything that interests me really, my current interests are Linux, Open Source contribution, Java, competitive coding, Go, etc.
Maybe steps to set something up or a breakdown of a notorious bug I came across and how to solve it or
maybe a getting started guide on a new language or framework.
