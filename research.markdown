Within the realm of computer science, I'm interested in the following fields and their intersections:

- Databases & Distributed Systems
- Artificial Intelligence
- Health Analytics

You can view my research publications [here](/publications).

You can read my database related blog posts [here](/tag/db/index.html).

On the health analytics side of things, I'm currently working on using [deep metric learning](http://contrib.scikit-learn.org/metric-learn/introduction.html){:target="_blank"} to build better Content Based Medical Image Retrieval (CBMIR) systems to aid medical staff. Previously, I've worked on multiple health analytics related projects like [Digital Stethoscope](https://github.com/pavan-kalyan/DigitalStethoscope){:target="_blank"}, and [Chest X-Ray Diagnostic System](https://github.com/pavan-kalyan/chest-xray-classification-azure){:target="_blank"}.
